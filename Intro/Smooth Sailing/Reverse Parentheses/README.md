<h1>Reverse Parentheses</h1>

<p>You have a string s that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. It is guaranteed that the parentheses in s form a regular bracket sequence.

   Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. The results string should not contain any parentheses.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>

<ul>
<li>For string s = "a(bc)de", the output should be
    reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde".</li>
</ul>
